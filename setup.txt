SpiritDAO Mobile App Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   Run the following command in the project root directory:
   npm install

2. Set up environment variables:
   Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following variables:
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
   REACT_APP_DAO_WALLET_ADDRESS=your_dao_wallet_address
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

3. Set up the database:
   Make sure MongoDB is installed and running on your system.
   The application will create the necessary collections automatically.

4. Run the application:
   For development (running both server and client concurrently):
   npm run "dev:full"  

   For production:
   npm run build (to build the React app)
   npm start (to start the server)

5. Access the application:
   Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 (for development)
   or http://localhost:5000 (for production)

Note: Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the .env file with your actual credentials and settings.

Additional setup steps:
1. Set up a Stripe account and obtain the necessary API keys.
2. Configure your DAO wallet address for cryptocurrency payments.
3. Set up a MongoDB database (local or cloud-based) and update the MONGODB_URI in the .env file.
4. (Optional) Set up a cloud storage service for file uploads if you plan to deploy the app to a hosting service.
