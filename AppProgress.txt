DETAILED PROJECT OVERVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Wallet Authentication Logic
Current Files:
C:\dao-app\src\services\walletAuth.js
C:\dao-app\src\routes\auth.js
Issues: Redundant authentication logic spread across multiple files.
Solution: Consolidate all wallet authentication and membership verification logic into walletAuth.js.
Recommendations:
Ensure all authentication routes in auth.js call methods from walletAuth.js.
Centralize error handling for authentication processes within walletAuth.js.
2. Payment Processing
Current Files:
C:\dao-app\src\services\stripePayment.js
C:\dao-app\src\services\stripePayments.js
C:\dao-app\src\services\cryptoPayment.js
C:\dao-app\src\services\cryptoPayments.js
Issues: Duplicate logic for handling Stripe and crypto payments.
Solution: Merge payment handling into unified services, e.g., paymentService.js.
Recommendations:
Create a single paymentService.js that includes:
Methods for creating and confirming Stripe payments.
Methods for processing crypto payments.
Unified error handling and logging for payment processes.
Refactor payment-related routes to use the unified paymentService.js.
3. API Requests
Current Files:
C:\dao-app\src\utils\api.js
C:\dao-app\src\services\notificationService.js
Issues: Redundant API request logic.
Solution: Centralize API request logic in api.js.
Recommendations:
Move all Axios configurations and interceptors to api.js.
Ensure notificationService.js uses methods from api.js for API requests.
Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic in api.js.
4. Notification Handling
Current Files:
C:\dao-app\src\services\notificationService.js
C:\dao-app\src\utils\notificationUtils.js
Issues: Duplicate logic for sending notifications.
Solution: Consolidate notification logic into notificationUtils.js.
Recommendations:
Ensure notificationService.js only handles client-side notification requests.
Move server-side notification logic and utilities to notificationUtils.js.
Add robust error handling and logging for notification processes.
5. Centralized Error Handling
Current Files: Various route files, e.g., C:\dao-app\src\routes\*.js
Issues: Inconsistent error handling across routes.
Solution: Implement centralized error handling middleware.
Recommendations:
Create an error handling middleware (e.g., C:\dao-app\src\middleware\errorHandler.js).
Use this middleware in C:\dao-app\src\app.js to catch and handle all errors.
Ensure all route files utilize the centralized error handling middleware.
6. Enhanced Logging
Current Files: Various service and route files.
Issues: Sporadic and inconsistent logging.
Solution: Implement centralized logging using a library like winston.
Recommendations:
Create a centralized logging service (e.g., C:\dao-app\src\services\loggingService.js).
Replace all console.error and console.log statements with calls to the logging service.
Configure winston to handle different logging levels and output logs to appropriate destinations (e.g., files, console).
7. API Documentation
Current Files: Various route files, e.g., C:\dao-app\src\routes\*.js
Issues: Limited documentation of API endpoints.
Solution: Use Swagger to generate API documentation.
Recommendations:
Add Swagger setup in C:\dao-app\src\app.js.
Create a Swagger configuration file (e.g., C:\dao-app\src\config\swagger.js).
Document all API endpoints using Swagger annotations.
8. Testing and Validation
Current Files: Various service and route files.
Issues: Unclear and potentially insufficient testing coverage.
Solution: Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest and Mocha.
Recommendations:
Create test files for each major service and route (e.g., C:\dao-app\tests\services\walletAuth.test.js).
Ensure all critical paths are thoroughly tested, especially authentication, payment processing, and proposal voting.
Add test coverage reporting to ensure all parts of the application are tested.
9. Code Consistency and Style
Current Files: Entire codebase.
Issues: Minor inconsistencies in coding style.
Solution: Adopt a consistent coding style using ESLint and Prettier.
Recommendations:
Create a shared ESLint and Prettier configuration (e.g., .eslintrc.js, .prettierrc).
Add linting and formatting scripts to package.json.
Ensure all developers adhere to the shared configuration.
